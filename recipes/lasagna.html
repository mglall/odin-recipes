    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the<br>
         type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made<br>
          with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other<br>
           ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna<br>
            noodles.
    </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li> ¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>step 1</strong><p>in a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until<br> well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.<br> Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and<br> 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><strong>step 2</strong><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling<br> water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,<br> combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></li>
        <li><strong>step 3</strong><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>step 4</strong><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br> dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of<br> the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups<br> meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat<br> layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to<br> prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not<br> touch the cheese.</p></li>
        <li><strong>step 5</strong><p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25<br> minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p></li>
